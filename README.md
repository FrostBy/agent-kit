## What it shows

- **Context**: used tokens out of the window (`84k/200k`, `170k/1M`), with a bar coloured by threshold.
- **Limits**: the 5-hour and weekly windows with time to reset, plus per-model weekly limits such as Fable. When you burn faster than the window runs, the numbers turn red and `out in 1d9h` says when the limit runs out at this pace.
- **Git in umbrella folders**: launched in a folder that holds several repos, it lists every repo with uncommitted or unpushed work on its own line, aligned in columns, marks the one Claude is in with `▸` and adds up the lines (`Σ`). Inside a single repo it shows that repo.
- **Activity**: the running tool and its argument, todo progress, running subagents, the PR of the branch with its review state.
- **Money only when it is money**: session cost and today's spend across all sessions appear on API billing, or on a subscription once extra usage starts being spent in the current session. Within the subscription limits they stay hidden.
- **Subagent rows**: a line per subagent in the agents panel with model, effort, tokens, share of context and a sparkline.

## Install

Install it globally from GitHub, then point Claude Code at it:

```sh
npm install -g github:FrostBy/claude-statusline-ultimate
claude-statusline-ultimate --install
```

`--install` writes `statusLine` and `subagentStatusLine` into `~/.claude/settings.json` as `node "<install path>/statusline.js"`, so each render runs the installed copy and fetches nothing. The previous values are saved and `--uninstall` puts them back. The settings file is left untouched if it does not parse.

To update, run the `npm install -g` line again.

## Configure

```sh
claude-statusline-ultimate --configure
```

The editor shows a live preview on sample data. Keys: `↑↓` select, `a` add a widget, `d` delete, `K`/`J` move, `|` separator, `Enter` widget options, `n` new line, `g` global settings, `s` save, `q` quit. In mintty or Git Bash run it through `winpty`.

The config lives in `~/.claude/statusline.json` (override the path with `CLAUDE_STATUSLINE_CONFIG`). Anything missing comes from the defaults, and `--init` writes them out.

```json
{
  "lines": [
    ["model", "effort", "fast", "|", "context", "|", "activity", "|", "todos", "|", "subagents"],
    ["limit-5h", "|", "limit-7d", "|", "limit-model"],
    ["cost", "|", "cost-today", "|", "cache", "|", "pr"],
    ["git", "|", "worktree"]
  ],
  "widgets": { "context": { "bar": 8 }, "git": { "max": 6, "branchMax": 30 } },
  "colors": { "model": "#c792ea", "branch": "magenta" }
}
```

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `lines` | see above | Widgets per line. `"\|"` starts a new group. An item can be an object with options: `{ "id": "text", "value": "🔥" }` |
| `separator` | three spaces | Between groups |
| `gapAfter` | `true` | Empty line after the status line, above Claude Code's own mode line |
| `money` | `auto` | `auto`: money only on API billing or extra usage; `always`: always |
| `lang` | `auto` | `en`, `ru`, or `auto` from the system locale |
| `icons` | `unicode` | `unicode`, `ascii` for plain terminals, `nerd` for Nerd Fonts |
| `colors` | | ANSI names (`cyan`, `brightRed`, `gray`…) or `#rrggbb`. `NO_COLOR` turns colours off |
| `thresholds` | `50` / `80` | Percent where values turn yellow and red |
| `pricing` | | Override model prices, $ per 1M tokens: `{ "claude-opus-5-5": { "in": 4, "out": 20, "read": 0.2 } }` |
| `usageTtl`, `todayTtl` | `120`, `300` | How often the usage API and today's spend refresh, seconds |

Other commands: `--preview` renders sample data in the current folder, `--list [--md]` lists every widget with its options.

## How it works

- Claude Code pipes session JSON to the command and shows what it prints. Only the sources the current layout needs are loaded.
- Git runs in parallel across repos with a 400 ms budget. Past it, the last known state is shown and the scan finishes in a detached process, so the render never waits.
- The usage API and today's spend refresh in detached processes on their TTL.
- Today's spend is priced per model from the `usage` of each response in today's transcripts, subagents included, with duplicate content blocks counted once. Files are read incrementally, gigabyte-sized ones in chunks.
- Git is read from the folder the session was launched in, so a `cd` into one repo does not hide the others.
- The cache lives in `claude-statusline` under the system temp folder.

## Windows Terminal

Cascadia Mono, the default font, lacks some symbols. Windows draws them from a fallback font, wider than a cell, and they overlap the next character. The default icons were checked by eye in Windows Terminal: missing glyphs are emoji or get an extra space. Claude Code also trims leading spaces on every line, so the indent of the git rows starts with U+2800, a blank braille cell.

## Privacy

Per-model limits, extra usage and money on a subscription need the account usage. For that the status line reads the Claude Code OAuth token from `~/.claude/.credentials.json` and calls `api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage`, the endpoint behind `/usage`. It is undocumented and may change. The token goes nowhere else. Leave `limit-model`, `extra-usage`, `week-breakdown` and the money widgets (`cost`, `burn-rate`, `cost-today`) out of the layout, and no request is made.
